# HTML-Begining  
Purpose:

This repository contains my basic HTML practice files.  

I'm using this repo to learn and store simple HTML programs while I study HTML with the help of CodÃ©dex.

Most of them are small practice exercises created by the platform like CodÃ©dex.

 ðŸ“Œ Note:
This is a public repository. Feel free to explore it if you're learning HTML too!
